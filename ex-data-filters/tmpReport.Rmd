## Welcome

This tutorial is based on the `learnr` demo tutorials showing functions to `filter`, `summarise`, and `mutate`. The source for those original tutorials can be found at [github](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/tree/master/inst/tutorials/).

###  

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* use `filter()` to extract observations from a data frame or tibble
* write logical tests in R
* combine logical tests with Boolean operators
* handle missing values within logical tests

The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2. 

### Prerequisites

To practice these skills, we will use the `flights` data set from the nycflights13 package. This data frame comes from the US [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0) and contains all `r format(nrow(nycflights13::flights), big.mark = ",")` flights that departed from New York City in 2013. It is documented in `?flights`.

We will also use the ggplot2 package to visualize the data.

## Filter rows with `filter()`

### filter()

`filter()` lets you use a logical test to extract specific rows from a data frame. To use `filter()`, pass it the data frame followed by one or more logical tests. `filter()` will return every row that passes each logical test.

So for example, we can use `filter()` to select every flight in flights that departed on January 1st. Click Run Code to give it a try:

```{r filter1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


###  output

Like all dplyr functions, `filter()` returns a new data frame for you to save or use. It doesn't overwrite the old data frame. 

If you want to save the output of `filter()`, you'll need to use the assignment operator, `<-`. 

Rerun the command in the code chunk below, but first arrange to save the output to an object named `jan1`.

```{r filter2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r filter2-solution}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

###  

Good job! You can now see the results by running the name jan1 by itself. Or you can pass `jan1` to a function that takes data frames as input.

Did you notice that this code used the double equal operator, `==`? `==` is one of R's logical comparison operators. Comparison operators are key to using `filter()`, so let's take a look at them.

## Logical Comparisons

### Comparison operators

R provides a suite of comparison operators that you can use to compare values: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!=` (not equal), and `==` (equal). Each creates a logical test. For example, is `pi` greater than three?

```{r}
pi > 3
```

###  

When you place a logical test inside of `filter()`, filter applies the test to each row in the data frame and then returns the rows that pass, as a new data frame.

Our code above returned every row whose month value was equal to one _and_ whose day value was equal to one.

### Watch out!

When you start out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to test for equality with `=` instead of `==`. When this happens you'll get an informative error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
filter(flights, month = 1)
```

### Multiple tests

If you give `filter()` more than one logical test, `filter()` will combine the tests with an implied "and." In other words, `filter()` will return only the rows that return `TRUE` for every test. You can combine tests in other ways with Boolean operators... 

## Boolean operators

### &, |, and !

R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into a single logical test. These include `&` (_and_), `|` (_or_), `!` (_not_ or _negation_), and `xor()` (_exactly or_). 

Both `|` and `xor()` will return TRUE if one or the other logical comparison returns TRUE. `xor()` differs from `|` in that it will return FALSE if both logical comparisons return TRUE. The name _xor_ stands for _exactly or_.

Study the diagram below to get a feel for how these operators work.

```{r fig1, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "In the figure above, `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each command selects."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/transform-logical.png")
```

### Test Your Knowledge

```{r logicals, echo = FALSE}
question(" What will the following code return? `filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)`",
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _or_ December", correct = TRUE),
         answer("Every flight that departed in November _and_ December", message = "Technically a flight could not have departed in November _and_ December unless it departed twice."),
         answer("Every flight _except for_ those that departed in November or December"),
         answer("An error. This is an incorrect way to combine tests.", message = "The next section will say a little more about combining tests."),
         allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Common mistakes

In R, the order of operations doesn't work like English. You can't write `filter(flights, month == 11 | 12)`, even though you might say  "finds all flights that departed in November or December". Be sure to write out a _complete_ test on each side of a boolean operator.

Here are four more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean operators in R:

###  

1. A useful short-hand for this problem is `x %in% y`. This will select every row where `x` is one of the values in `y`. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question above:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
    ```

###  

2. Sometimes you can simplify complicated subsetting by remembering De Morgan's law: `!(x & y)` is the same as `!x | !y`, and `!(x | y)` is the same as `!x & !y`. For example, if you wanted to find flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours, you could use either of the following two filters:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
    filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
    ```

###  

3. As well as `&` and `|`, R also has `&&` and `||`. Don't use them with `filter()`! You'll learn when you should use them later.

###  

4. Whenever you start using complicated, multipart expressions in `filter()`, consider making them explicit variables instead. That makes it much easier to check your work. You'll learn how to create new variables shortly.

## Missing values

### NA

Missing values can make comparisons tricky in R. R uses `NA` to represent missing or unknown values. `NA`s are "contagious" because almost any operation involving an unknown value (`NA`) will also be unknown (`NA`). For example, can you determine what value these expressions that use missing values should evaluate to? Make a prediction and then click "Submit Answer".

```{r nas, exercise = TRUE}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
NA == NA
```

```{r nas-check}
"In every case, R does not have enough information to compute a result. Hence, each result is an unknown value, `NA`."
```

### is.na()

The most confusing result above is this one:

```{r not-na}
NA == NA
```

It's easiest to understand why this is true with a bit more context:

```{r mary}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
# We don't know!
```

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r na}
is.na(x)
```

### filter() and NAs

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE`; it excludes both `FALSE` and `NA` values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly:

```{r filter}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use the code chunks below to find all flights that

1. Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

    ```{r filterex1, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex1-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120) # arr_delay is in minutes
    ```

1. Flew to Houston (`IAH` or `HOU`)

    ```{r filterex2, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex2-solution}
    filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex2-hint">
    **Hint:** This is a good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>

1. Were operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)

    ```{r filterex3, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex3-solution}
    filter(flights, carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex3-hint">
    **Hint:** The `carrier` variable lists the airline that operated each flight. This is another good case for the `%in%` operator.
    </div>
    
1. Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    
    ```{r filterex4, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex4-solution}
    filter(flights, 6 < month, month < 10)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex4-hint">
    **Hint:** When converted to numbers, July, August, and September become 7, 8, and 9.
    </div>

1. Arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

    ```{r filterex5, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex5-solution}
    filter(flights, arr_delay > 120, dep_delay <= 0)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex5-hint">
    **Hint:** Remember that departure and arrival delays are recorded in     _minutes_.
    </div>

1. Were delayed more than an hour, but made up more than 30 minutes in flight
    
    ```{r filterex6, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex6-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_delay > 60, (dep_delay - arr_delay) > 30)
    ```

    <div id="filterex6-hint">
    **Hint:** The time a plane makes up is `dep_delay - arr_delay`.
    </div>
        
1. Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

    ```{r filterex7, exercise = TRUE}
    
    ```
    ```{r filterex7-solution}
    filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400)
    ```
    
    <div id="filterex7-hint">
    **Hint:** Don't forget flights that left at exactly midnight (`2400`). This is a good case for an "or" operator.
    </div>

### Exercise 2

How many flights have a missing `dep_time`? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r filterex9, exercise = TRUE}
    
```

```{r filterex9-solution}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```
    
<div id="filterex9-hint">
**Hint:** This is a good case for `is.na()`.
</div>

```{r filterex9-check}
"Good Job! these look like they might be cancelled flights."
```

### Exercise 3

Why is `NA ^ 0` not missing? Why is `NA | TRUE` not missing?
Why is `FALSE & NA` not missing? Can you figure out the general rule?  (`NA * 0` is a tricky counterexample!)
    
```{r filterex10, exercise = TRUE}
    
```

```{r filterex10-hint-1}
# any number with a zero exponent is equal to one
NA ^ 0
```

```{r filterex10-hint-2}
# unknown value or true evaluates to true 
# (because if one operand of "or" is true, we can be sure the result is true)
NA | TRUE
```

```{r filterex10-hint-3}
# false and unknown value evaluates to false
# (because if one operand of "and" is true, we can be sure the result is false)
FALSE & NA
```

```{r filterex10-hint-4}
# this is not a logical comparison, it's a numerical calculation involving an
# unknown value, thus resulting in an unknown value
NA * 0
```

## Add new variables with mutate()

A data set often contains information that you can use to compute new variables. `mutate()` helps you compute those variables. Since `mutate()` always adds new columns to the end of a dataset, we'll start by creating a narrow dataset which will let us see the new variables (If we added new variables to `flights`, the new columns would run off the side of your screen, which would make them hard to see). 

### select()

You can select a subset of variables by name with the `select()` function in dplyr. Run the code below to see the narrow data set that `select()` creates.

```{r select, exercise = TRUE}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  arr_delay, 
  dep_delay,
  distance, 
  air_time
)
```


### mutate()

The code below creates two new variables with dplyr's `mutate()` function. `mutate()` returns a new data frame that contains the new variables appended to a copy of the original data set. Take a moment to imagine what this will look like, and then click "Run Code" to find out.

```{r mutate1-setup}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  arr_delay, 
  dep_delay,
  distance, 
  air_time
)
```

```{r mutate1, exercise = TRUE}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

Note that when you use `mutate()` you can create multiple variables at once, and you can even refer to variables that are created earlier in the call to create other variables later in the call:

```{r mutate-1, echo = FALSE}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  arr_delay, 
  dep_delay,
  distance, 
  air_time
)
```

```{r mutate-2}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

### transmute()

`mutate()` will always return the new variables appended to a copy of the original data. If you want to return only the new variables, use `transmute()`. In the code below, replace `mutate()` with `transmute()` and then spot the difference in the results.

```{r transmute, exercise = TRUE}
mutate(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

```{r transmute-solution}
transmute(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

```{r transmute-code-check}
"Excellent job! `transmute()` and `mutate()` do the same thing, but `transmute()` only returnsd the new variables. `mutate()` returns a copy of the original data set with the new variables appended."
```
## Exercises

```{r first, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
flights <- flights %>% mutate(
  dep_time = hour * 60 + minute,
  arr_time = (arr_time %/% 100) * 60 + (arr_time %% 100),
  airtime2 = arr_time - dep_time,
  dep_sched = dep_time + dep_delay
)

ggplot(flights, aes(dep_sched)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 60)
ggplot(flights, aes(dep_sched %% 60)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
ggplot(flights, aes(air_time - airtime2)) + geom_histogram()
```
### Exercise 2

Compare `air_time` with `arr_time - dep_time`. What do you expect to see? What do you see? How do you explain this?
    
```{r mutateex2, exercise = TRUE}
# flights <- mutate(flights, total_time = _____________)
# flight_times <- select(flights, air_time, total_time)
# filter(flight_times, air_time != total_time)
```
```{r mutateex2-solution}
flights <- mutate(flights, total_time = arr_time - dep_time)
flight_times <- select(flights, air_time, total_time)
filter(flight_times, air_time != total_time)
```

```{r mutateex2-check}
"Good Job! it doesn't make sense to do math with `arr_time` and `dep_time` until you convert the values to minutes past midnight (as you did with `dep_time` and `sched_dep_time` in the previous exercise)."
```
